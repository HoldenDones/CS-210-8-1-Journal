The project I chose to upload is the Zoo animal program from project 3. This project needed to store zoo animal information by allowing the user to input whatever data they had on the animals. After taking in the information it would create a text document displaying the inputted information in a categorized chart. This program is supposed to help zoo workers stay organized and on top of their animalsâ€™ information through a quick and simple process. In this project, I was able to make the program work smoothly and create an organized zoo animal chart.  To enhance my code I could make the chart more structured with boxes and titles. This would make it more visibly appealing to the users. 
	The part of this code I found challenging was figuring out to interact with the two languages, Java and C++, to make them produce a new text file with all the information needed. I was able to overcome this challenge by reviewing the course materials and learning more about how the process works. Combining two programming languages is a good transferable skill because it will be used in the future to create effective programs. I made this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable by making the code clear and organized.
